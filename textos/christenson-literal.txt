    1
    The prefix xchi- is no longer used in modern K'iche'. It was used in the Popol Vuh text to indicate the certainty of a future action or
event, as in "it shall be done."
    2
   Wi has no English equivalent. It may be used as a directional indicator, a marker to connote certainty, or a means of giving added
emphasis to a verb.
    3
    This is an example of a parallel triplet arrangement, which is comparatively rare in the text. Not only are each of the three ideas
parallel in lines 11-13, but they are grammatically parallel as well, each verb appearing in the passive voice.
    4
     The manuscript reads euaxibal (that which is hidden). This is likely a scribal error for auaxibal (that which is sown). Throughout the
text, sowing and dawning are paired as referents to the creation (see lines 196-197, 209-210, 442-443, 543-544, 612-613, 1653-1654, and
5091-5092) .

        The manuscript reads tzÿz here, although elsewhere in the text it reads zÿz. The manuscript interchanges tz with z frequently.
    6
    The manuscript reads tzel, another example of tz/z substitution. Zel is the more common spelling in the manuscript, and this is the
pronunciation used among the modern K'iche'.
    7
     This passage was the first example of chiasmus that I found in the Popol Vuh. Throughout the document, female deities are listed
before male deities when paired in parallel couplets. It thus made little sense that Xpiyacoc, the name of the grandfather god, would be
written before that of Xmucane, his female counterpart. When it is recognized that the passage is arranged as a chiasm, or reverse
parallism, the confusion disappears.
    8
        In this chiastic arrangement, Xmucane is paired with her title as "midwife" in line 32.

     The next four lines are organized into a parallel quatrain, perhaps to emphasize the creation of the four corners and sides of earth and
sky by the gods. Thus the poetic structure of the passage is organized into four-fold symmetry reflecting the four-fold nature of the
universe.

      In the K'iche' language, verbs may be nominalized in a number of ways by adding an appropriate prefix or suffix to the verb's root
form. The following series of parallel couplets are arranged in such a way that various nominalization prefixes and suffixes are paired.
Lines 80-81 use the suffix -em, which converts the verb roots into gerunds; lines 82-83 use the suffix -el, which converts the verb roots
into person agents (a "doer" of the verb's action); lines 84-85 use the suffix -ay, which is an alternative means of nominalizing verbs into
the person agent form; lines 89-90 use the prefix aj, which indicates that the person agent has that verb as his/her principal occupation.

worship), a word which appears in similar contexts elsewhere in the manuscript. This is apparently an instance of scribal error, or perhaps
an archaic spelling of the word which has since fallen out of usage.
   16
        The manuscript reads quicha, which is grammatically impossible for an intransitive verb.


                                                                                                                                          13

Not therefore they succeeded,                                            Ma k'u xutzinik,

 He Who Has Begotten Sons.                                                K'ajolom.
They were told therefore:                                                Xe'uchax k'ut:

"Merely you are replaced,                                                "Xa kixjalatajik

     17
      This triplet parallels in a negative way the triplet of lines 373-375. The newly-created animals were commanded to speak, but
instead they merely squawked; they were commanded to call upon the gods, but they merely chattered; they were commanded to worship
the gods, but they merely roared.
     18
      The manuscript reads quevachelahic, likely a scribal error for quevechelahic. According to Coto, -wech'el is to "squawk, screech, or
make the sounds of a large bird such as a hawk." Mondloch notes that in current K'iche' usage, wech'om tzij is distorted or unintelligible
speech (personal communication).
   19
      This is an unusual arrangement of parallel couplets into a chiastic form, rather than individual ideas. An even longer example may
be seen in lines 444-457. Considering the authors' fondness for parallel couplets as well as chiasms, I find it odd that there aren't more
examples of this type of arrangement in the text.

This therefore you will serve,"                                           Are' k'ut chipatanij,"

They were told.                                                           Xe'uchaxik.

Large animals that are upon its face earth.                               Nima chikop k'o chuwach ulew.

Then they wanted therefore to try again their day,20                      Ta xraj k'u kitij chik ki q'ij,
They wanted to make an attempt again,                                     Xraj kitijitob'ej chik,

   20
      This triplet appears to be antithetical to the triplet which immediately follows it. The reasoning is that "they wanted to try again
their day (their luck) but they didn't hear their speech among them. They wanted to make an attempt again, but it wasn't comprehended.
They wanted to arrange again [their] worship, but it wasn't made to be as well."



                                                                                                                                             15
They wanted also to arrange again worship.                              Xraj pu kinuk' chik q'ijilab'al.

It wasn't heard their speech to each other,                             Xma xkita wi ki ch'ab'al chi kib'il kib',
It wasn't successful therefore,                                         Xma xnawachir wi k'ut,
It wasn't made to be as well.                                           Xma xb'anataj wi puch.

Thus was defeated their flesh,                                          Keje' k'ut xech'akataj wi ki tio'jil,

     21
    The manuscript seems to read cu (therefore), although Ximénez often writes a and u in a similar way. Mondloch notes that for
grammatic reasons this line should read ca tiha (let us try), which matches the construction in line 452 (personal communication).

     30
      The manuscript here reads ix (you) rather than in (I), which makes little sense in the context of the passage, as well as the parallel
lines that follow. This is evidently an error in transcription of the text.


     31
     The manuscript reads quiyou (block out, impede), which Mondloch (personal communication) suggests is likely a scribal error for
quiyohou (destroy, ruin, fell).

     In this brief section, from lines 1008-1023, the brother of Xbalanque is referred to in the original manuscript as Hun Hunahpu, the
name used exclusively in the remainder of the text for the father of the twin boys. This is unlikely to be a scribal error because it is
repeated consistently. This is more likely evidence of a different K'iche' author, supporting the conclusion that the Popol Vuh is the
product of several scribes.

                                                                                                                                           35

     The parallelism of xkam (he died), and xuk'am (he took), is based not on a similarity of concept but rather a play on the similar
pronunciation of the respective verb roots, a form of intentional punning which the Maya dearly love to do both in every day conversation
as well as in literature.

      The manuscript reads chiquicololej (to place, set apart), which does not fit the context or syntax of the sentence. It is likely a scribal
error for chiquitzololej, matching the phrase in line 2426.
   54
      The manuscript reads quipus, likely a scribal error for quinipus (Mondloch, personal communication).

   55
     The manuscript reads i qux (your [second person plural] heart), rather than a qux (your [second person singular] heart). This form of
address is sometimes used in the text as a means of showing respect, although later in this passage the maiden is addressed by the owls
using the more familiar second person singular form, thus this may simply be a scribal error.
   56
        The root words in this parallel triplet-- tzololej, tz'aqixtax, and tz'aqik-- may have been chosen for their alliterative quality.
   57
        The manuscript reads chicut, which is apparently a scribal error for chicat.

   59
     This is the perfect form of the verb uk'a'axik, but for this verb, and other durative verbs, the meaning of the perfect is that the action
began sometime in the past relative to the time spoken of, and continues up to that time. Thus in this context, the meaning is "I am
carrying," rather than "I have carried" (Mondloch, personal communication).
   60
        The manuscript reads catbal (impediment), which is likely a scribal error for cutbal (manifestation).

                                                                                                                                                  89

Ugly their faces she saw grandmother.         Itzel ki wach xril ati't.

Then she laughed,                             Ta xtze'nik,
Not she held back her laughter grandmother.   Mawi xukuy u tze' ati't.

 She would laugh grandmother.                                Chutze'j ati't.

Merely therefore she would contain her laughter the their   Xa k'u chukuyuka' u tze' ri kati't.

They climbed up therefore hither,                           Xe'aq'an k'u uloq,
They would scamper wall.                                    Chukatanaj tz'aq.

When she saw them again therefore the grandmother,          Ta xril chi k'ut ri ati't,               2970

                                                                                                            103
Then burst out again her laughter the their grandmother.   K'ate xpoq'olij chi u tze' ri kati't.

 Straightaway they went into forest.                        Ju su xeb'ek pa k'eche'laj.            2980
They said therefore to their grandmother:                  Xecha' k'ut chire kati't:

"Also we therefore tried it you our grandmother.           "Mi k'u xqatijo ix qati't.

Merely they would stick it in its fork tree,                              Xa wi chikich'ikib'a' chutolok' che',
Merely its own strength tree it would fell.                               Xa wi chuq'ab' rib' che' chib'ek.

It would chop,                                          Chilajajik,
It would fell                                           Chib'ek

All trees,                                              Ronojel che',                                 3060

Feverishly now                                          Kaqchakachoj chik
It would cut down trees.                                Chiq'atoj che'.

It would do it the merely one axe.                      Chub'an ri xa juna ikaj.
This therefore the hoe thick it would break up,         Are' k'u ri mixk'ina' tzatz chiq'upuj,

Not counted stalks briars does the merely one hoe,      Mawi ajilan tum k'ixik kub'an ri xa jun chi

Not counted breaking up.                                Mawi ajilan q'upuj.

Merely small mountains,                                 Xa ch'uti juyub',
Great mountains it goes.                                Nima juyub' kab'ek.

Then they instructed therefore an animal,               Ta xkipixab'aj k'ut jun chikop,               3070
Turtle Dove its name.                                   Xmukur u b'i'.

They placed it up                                       Xkit'uyub'a' aq'anoq
On its top great stump.                                 Chuwi' nima kuta'm.

They spoke therefore Hunahpu,                           Xecha' k'ut Junajpu,
Xbalanque:                                              Xb'alanke:

"Merely you will see the our grandmother will come to   "Xa chawil ri qati't chipetik ya'ol qa wa,
       give our food,
Straightaway you cry out when she has come.             Ju su katoq'ik ta petoq.

Then therefore we will grasp the hoe,                   K'ate k'ut chiqachap ri mixk'ina',
With axe."                                              Ruk' ikaj."

"Good then that,"                                       "Utz b'a la',"                                3080
Said therefore the turtle dove.                         Xcha' k'u ri xmukur.

This therefore merely blowgun hunting they would do.    Are' k'ut xa wub'anik chikib'ano.
Not surely true maize farming then they would do.       Ma na qitzij ab'ixik ta chikib'ano.

Then also he would cry out the turtle dove,             K'ate puch choq' ri xmukur,

                                                                                                             107
Quickly therefore they come.                                 Anim k'ut kepetik.

One would grab hoe,                                          Jun chichapo mixk'ina',
One therefore would grab the axe.                            Jun k'ut chichapow ri ikaj.

They would put field debris on their heads,                  Chikipisla ki wi',
Without cause he would rub earth on his hands.               Xaloq' chub'aqala' ulew pu q'ab'.

The one merely like he would dirty his face,                 Ri jun xa keje' chutz'iloj u wach,             3090
Like truly had farmed maizefield.                            Keje' ri' qitzij ab'ixom.

This therefore the one other merely without cause toss its   Are' k'u ri jun chik xaloq' chupuk'ij u web'al che'
        chips wood on his head,                                      pu jolom,
Like truly cutter tree.                                      Keje' wi ri' qitzij q'atoj che'nel.

Then they were seen by their grandmother,                    Ta xil rumal kati't,
Then therefore they eat.                                     K'ate k'ut kewa'ik.

Not true maize farming they would do.                        Ma qitzij ab'ixik chikib'ano.
Without cause she would go to give their food.               Xaloq' chib'e ya'oq ki wa.

Then they went therefore to their home.                      Ta xeb'e k'ut chi kochoch.
 "Truly we are tired,                                         "Qitzij mi xojkosik,
 You our grandmothers,"                                       Ix qati't,"                                   3100
They say they arrive.                                        Kecha' ke'oponik.

Without cause they would rub,                                Xaloq' chikikikij,
They would stretch out also,                                 Chikiyuq puch,

Their legs,                                                  Kaqan,
Their arms before her face their grandmother.                Ki q'ab' chuwach kati't.

Then they went again therefore on second day,                Ta xeb'e chi k'ut chu ka q'ij,
They arrived therefore in their maizefield.                  Xe'opon k'ut pa kab'ix.

Completed having been raised up again all trees,             K'is yakatajinaq chik ronojel che',
Bushes.                                                      K'a'am.

They fastened themselves together again all shoots briars, U chapom chi rib' ronojel tun k'ixik,            3110

When they arrived.                                           Ta xe'oponik.

"Who is plucking at us?"                                     "Apachinaq kojmich'owik?"

They said therefore.                                       Xecha' k'ut.

These therefore they did it the all small animals,         Are' k'ut keb'anow ri ronojel ch'uti chikop,

Great birds.                                               Nima tz'ikin.

These they did it,                                         Are' xeb'anowik,
Merely one night they did it.                              Xa jun aq'ab' xkib'ano.

Then again therefore they began again maize farming.      K'ate chi k'ut xkitikib'a' chik ab'ixik.
 Merely it did again itself earth,                         Xa wi xub'an chi rib' ulew,

  Then were gathered again therefore their thoughts there   Ta xk'am chi k'u ki na'oj chiri' pa q'atoj che',
       on cut trees,
 On that broken up also.                                   Pa q'upuj puch.
"Merely we shall watch over by night the our maizefield. "Xa qa waraj ri qab'ix.

Whatever now surely is being done hither,                  Ana wi chi na kab'ano ulo,
That then we will discover it,"                            Laqi ta chiqariqo,"

They said therefore.                                       Xecha' k'ut.
Then were gathered their thoughts.                         Ta xk'am ki na'oj.

They arrived again therefore at house.                  Xe'opon chi k'ut chi ja.
"Someone perhaps is plucking at us you our grandmother. "Naqi ri' lo kojmich'owik ix qati't.

They said therefore to their grandmother,                      Xecha' k'ut chire kati't,
To also their mother.                                          Chire pu ki chuch.

They said.                                                     Xecha'.

Then therefore they concealed themselves,                      K'ate k'ut xeb'atz'onik,                      3150
Then therefore their going out again to their cutting trees.   K'ate k'ut ki b'ik chik pa ki q'atoj che'.

They were covered now there.                                   E muqumuxinaq chik chiri'.

Then they gathered therefore themselves all small animals, Ta xekuchu k'u kib' ronojel ch'uti chikop,
Merely one they got together,                              Xa jun xkisep wi kib',

This also zenith its heart night when they came.               Are' puch tik'il u k'u'x aq'ab' ta xepetik.
They chattered all when they came.                             Xech'awije'ik konojel ta xepetik.

They wanted therefore to grab them,                            Xraj k'u ki chapo,                            3170

Merely therefore by their tails they grabbed them,   Xa k'u chu je' xkichap wi,
Merely therefore they were broken off.               Xa k'u xq'upuq'ub'.

Left behind its tail deer in their hands             Kanajoq u je' kej pa ki q'ab'

Because this there was nothing they caught.          Rumal ri' maja b'i xkichapo.

Then therefore they netted him,                      K'ate k'ut xkik'atej,
They snared him therefore in net the rat.            Xkise k'ut pa k'at ri ch'o.

They said therefore                               Xecha' k'ut

Then they came therefore.                         Ta xepe k'ut.

Great cleared pathway therefore                   Nima jok k'u

Then he went,                                        Ta xb'ek,
Scuttling therefore he went.                         Chimalmat k'ut xb'ek.                            3410

Sitting therefore the boy in road,                   Ku'b'ul k'u ri k'ajol pa b'e,

"Go ahead,"                                                              "Katojo',"
He was told.                                                             Xuchaxik.

Then received the his food snake,                                        Ta xuk'am68 ri recha' kumatz,
They are swallowed toads today.                                          Keb'iq'ow xpeq wakamik.

He would go fast therefore the snake,                                    Chan k'u ri kumatz,

Was met again therefore the snake by falcon,                             Xk'ulutaj chi wi k'ut ri kumatz rumal wak,             3450
Great bird.                                                              Nima tz'ikin.

  When received his food the hawk,                                         Ta xuk'am recha' ri xik',
  They eat snakes in mountains.                                            Keti'ow kumatz pa taq juyub'.
Then he arrived also the falcon,                                         Ta xopon puch ri wak,
 He alighted on its top its rim ballcourt.                                Xchakachob' chuwi' u tzutz'il jom.

They rejoice therefore                                                   Keki'kot k'u                                           3460
 The Hunahpu,                                                             Ri Junajpu,

Then he arrived therefore the falcon.                                    Ta xopon k'ut ri wak.
Then cried out therefore the falcon:                                     Ta xoq' k'u ri wak:

"Wak-ko! Wak-ko!"                                                        "Wako! Wako!"
Said his cry falcon strongly.                                            Xcha' roq'ib'al wak ko.

"What this that cries out?                                               "Naqi pa ri' choq'ik?

   68
     This is likely a play on words. Xuk'am is "received," while the homophonous xuk'a'am is "carried." In this case the text explains the
origin of how snakes "received" their principal food, but at the same time this particular snake "carries" the toad bearing the message.

May come our blowguns!" they said.                         Peta' qa wub'!" xecha'.


THEN also they shot the falcon,                            K'ATE puch xkiwub'aj ri wak,                  3470

He was knocked down therefore,                             Chiselet k'ut,
He fell hither.                                            Xqaj uloq.

Truly therefore they went to grab him.                     Qitzij wi k'ut xb'e ki chapa'.
Then they asked:                                           K'ate xkitz'onoj:

"Why have you come?"                                       "Ju pa a petik?"
They said to falcon.                                       Xecha' chire wak.

"There is then my word in my belly.                        "K'o b'a nu tzij chi nu pam.

"Good then that,"                                          "Utz b'a la',"
They said therefore.                                       Xecha' k'ut.

Then they took out a little                                K'ate xkelesaj sqaqi'n
Its surface rubber the ball.                               Rij kik' ri cha'j.

They put it in his face the falcon,                        Xkikoj chi u wach ri wak,
Sliced Rubber it was named by them.                        Lotz Kik' xub'i'naj kumal.

Immediately then therefore was it cured by them,           Lib'aj chi k'ut xkach'oj kumal,
Good again his sight the falcon it became.                 Utz chik u muqub'al ri wak xuxik.

They said to falcon.                                       Xecha' chire wak.

Then therefore he vomited great snake.                     K'ate k'ut xuxawaj nima kumatz.
"Speak," they said again to snake.                         "Kach'awoq," xecha' chik chire kumatz.

"Fine," he said then therefore.                            "We'," xcha' chi k'ut.
Then he vomited again toad.                                Ta xuxawaj chi xpeq.

   72
        The manuscript reads julaj, which should be julajuj.
   73
        The manuscript does not give the name here, but it should be "Wing" (see line 1873, 3732).
   74
     The manuscript reads quic xic (Bloody Wing), although in line 3699, and in other places, this Xibalba lord is consistently named as
quic re (Bloody Teeth).

In its branches trees,                               Chuq'ab' taq che',
Garden as well.                                      Tiko'n puch.

They go toddling along there,                        Keb'e chakala chiri',
Merely only they would repeat the their song:        Xa wi xere chikich'ab'ej ri ki b'ix:

"Shpurpuwek,                                         "Xpurpuweq,
Shpurpuwek,"                                         Xpurpuweq,"

Says the one                                         Cha' ri jun                               3920

"Puhuyu,                                             "Pujuyu,

Says other,                                          Cha' chik
When he calls,                                       Ta choq'ik,

They two then                                        E kaib' chi
Guardians garden,                                    Chajal tiko'n,

Not therefore they sensed                                     Ma k'u kakina'
The ants stealers of what they had guarded.                   Ri sanik eleq'ay ki chajem.

They swarm,                                                   Kab'olowik,
They throng,                                                  Katukuwik,

Carriers away flowers,                                        Eray kotz'i'j,

Flowers                                                       Kotz'i'j
 In its tops trees theirs                                      Chuwi' che' re

The flowers.                                                  Ri kotz'i'j.

Merely thus they would break open their mouths the            Xa keje' chikiraquj ki chi' ri chajalib'.
       guardians.
Not surely theirs they sensed                                 Ma na re kakina'o

They gnawed their tails,                                      Kak'ux ki je',
They gnawed their wings.                                      Kak'ux ki xik'.

These are loosened flowers,                                   Are' kakirixik kotz'i'j,
Until they fall hither                                        K'a kaqaj uloq

Theirs they gather,                                           Re kasik'owik,
Theirs they go to cut hither.                                 Re kab'e q'atowa uloq.

Immediately then therefore were filled four bowls flowers, Lib'aj chi k'ut xnoj kajib' sel kotz'i'j,      3950
Accumulated now therefore when it dawned.                  Tik'itoj chi k'ut ta xsaqirik.

Then therefore arrived messengers,                            K'ate k'ut ta xul samajel,
Summoners,                                                    Taqonel,

"`Come!' says lord,                                           "`Kepetoq!' kacha' ajaw,
`Straightaway may they bring hither the our prize,'"          `Ju suk' chikik'am ula ri qa ch'ako'n,'"

They were told therefore boys.                                Xe'uchax k'ut k'ajolab'.
"Good then that," they said therefore.                        "Utz b'a la'," xecha' k'ut.

They had accumulated therefore                                Ki tik'ela'on k'u
The flowers four bowls.                                       Ri kotz'i'j kajib' sel.


                                                                                                                 137
Then they went,                                        Ta xeb'ek,                                    3960
Then they arrived therefore                            Ta xe'opon k'u

Before their faces lords.                              Chikiwach ajaw.
Lords having received flowers woeful their faces.      Ajawab' kuk'am kotz'i'j q'us u wach.

Thus they were defeated Xibalbans.                     Keje' k'ut xech'akataj wi Xib'alb'a.
Merely ants they sent the boys.                        Xa sanik xkitaq ri k'ajolab'.

Merely all night they took them ants,                  Xa jun aq'ab'il xkichap sanik,
Then they put them in bowls.                           Ta kiya' pa sel.

Thus they turned pale the all Xibalbans,               Keje' k'ut xesaqkaje' ri konojel Xib'alb'a,
Pallid their faces because of the flowers.             Saqb'uk ki wach rumal ri kotz'i'j.

Then therefore they summoned the guardians flowers:    K'ate k'ut xkitaq ri chajal kotz'i'j:          3970
 "What its reason you gave our flowers to be stolen?    "Naqi pa rumal mi xiya' qa kotz'i'j chi eleq'axik?
 These our flowers these you see,"                      Are' qa kotz'i'j wa'e kawilo,"
They were told guardians.                              Xe'uchax chajal.

"Not then we sensed it you lords,                      "Ma b'a xqana'o at ajaw,
But surely theirs they suffered our tails,"            Mi na re xkuyu qa je',"

They said therefore.                                   Xecha' k'ut.
Then also were split open their mouths,                K'ate puch xjix ki chi',

Their punishment                                       Ki tojb'al
They guarded now was stolen.                           Ki chajin chi eleq'axik.

Thus their defeat One Death,                           Keje' k'ut ki ch'akatajik Jun Kame,           3980
Seven Death,                                           Wuqub' Kame,

By Hunahpu,                                            Kumal Junajpu,
Xbalanque.                                             Xb'alanke.

Its root the deed this,                                U xe' ri b'anoj ri',
Then they received the their mouths gaping.            Ta xkik'am ri ki chi' jereb'aq.

Their mouths whippoorwills                             Ki chi' purpuweq
Gaping to this day.                                    Jereb'aq wakamik.

Then again therefore was dropped ball,                 K'ate chi k'ut ta xqaj cha'j,
Merely only equal they played ball.                    Xa wi xere junam kecha'jik.

138
They finished again therefore playing ball,                             Xkelej chi k'u cha'j,                                 3990
Then they took counsel again therefore together.                        Ta xepixab'an chi k'u kib'.

"Dawn again," they said Xibalbans.                                      "Saqirik chik," xecha' Xib'alb'a.
"Good then that," said boys when they finished.                         "Utz b'a la'," xecha' k'ajolab' ta xkelej.


THEY entered now therefore in Cold House                                XE'OK chi k'ut pa Tew Ja.
  Not measured cold.                                                     Mawi ajilan tew.
  Thick with hail within house,                                          Tzatz chi saqb'oqom chupan ja,
Its home cold.                                                          Rochoch tew.

Straightaway therefore was dissipated cold.                             Ju su k'u stzaj77 tew.
 By them it was finished,                                                Rumal kutzina[q],78
 Ruined,                                                                 Ma'ina[q],                                           4000
Destroyed the cold by boys.                                             Xsach ri tew kumal k'ajolab'.

Not they died,                                                          Mawi xekamik,
 Instead they are alive                                                  Xa wi e k'aslik
  When it dawned.                                                         Ta xsaqirik.
   This then therefore wanted Xibalbans,                                   Are' ta k'u xkaj Xib'alb'a,
   There then they died.                                                   Chiri' ta xekam wi.
Not like that.                                                          Mawi keje'.
 Instead therefore good their faces                                      Xa wi k'u utz ki wach
  When it dawned.                                                         Ta xsaqirik.

They left again hither summoners theirs,                                Xekel chi ula taqol ke,                               4010
They went again guardians.                                              Xeb'e chik e chajal.

"What is it,                                                            "Naqi pa la',
Not they died?" said now its lords Xibalba.                             Mawi mi xekamik?" xcha' chi rajawal Xib'alb'a.

They marveled at again                                                  Xkimayijaj chik
Their deeds boys,                                                       Ki b'anoj k'ajolab',

Hunahpu,                                                                Junajpu,
Xbalanque.                                                              Xb'alanke.

   77
     The manuscript reads ztzah. The completive aspect should be xtzah, however, Mondloch (personal communication) points out that
the completive aspect prefix x- is pronounced s- when it occurs before tz, tz' or s. Thus xsaqirik is pronounced saqirik.
   78
      The manuscript reads cutz ma, although the "m" is uncharacteristically sloppy and could be an "n." I agree with Edmonson that this
is likely a scribal error for cutzina[c].

                                                                                                                                      139
THEN they entered again therefore in Jaguar House.                        K'ATE xe'ok chi k'ut pa B'alami Ja.
Crowded with jaguars Jaguar's Home.                                       Tzatz chi b'alam B'alam Rochoch.

"Not you eat us.                                                          "Mawi kojiti'o.                               4020
There is yours will become," they were told jaguars.                      K'o iwech chuxik," xe'uchaxik b'alam.

Then therefore they scattered bones before beasts,                        K'ate k'ut xkipuk'ij b'aq chikiwach chikop,
Then therefore they crunch there over bones.                              K'ate k'ut kepaq'aq'ik chiri' chuwi' b'aq.

"They were therefore finished,                                            "Mi k'u xe'utzinik,
They ate their hearts.                                                    Mi xutij ki k'u'x.

Then they gave themselves.                                                K'ate wi ri mi xkiya' kib'.
These their skeletons that are being gnawed on,"                          Are' ki b'aqil ri kak'uxixik,"

Said the night watchmen.                                                  Xecha' ri waranel.
All of them sweet their hearts to it.                                     Konojel ki' ki k'u'x chire.

Not therefore they died,                                                  Ma k'u xekamik,                               4030
Merely only good their faces.                                             Xa wi xere utz ki wach.

They came out hither                                                      Xe'el uloq
From Jaguar House.                                                        Pa B'alami Ja.

"What therefore now kind of people?                                       "Naqi pa k'u79 chi e winaqil?
Where therefore did they come from?"                                      Apa k'u xepe wi?"

They said the Xibalbans,                                                  Xecha' ri Xib'alb'a,
All of them.                                                              Konojel.


THEN again they entered into fire,                                        K'ATE chik xe'ok chupam q'aq',
Another house of fire.                                                    Jun ja chi q'aq'.

Merely alone fire its interior,                                           Xa u tukel q'aq' u pam,                       4040
Not they were burned by it.                                               Mawi xek'atik rumal.

Merely they were to be roasted,                                           Xa b'olol,
Merely they were to be set on fire.                                       Xa tzimaj wi.

  79
       The manuscript reads qui which is likely a scribal error for cu.

Instead only good now                               Xa wi xere utz chi

Not so.                                             Mawi keje'.                              4050
Merely lost their hearts Xibalbans because of it.   Xa wi kasach ki k'u'x Xib'alb'a rumal.


THEY were put again inside Bat House,               XEKOJ chik chupan Sotz'in Ja,
Alone bats inside next house.                       U tukel sotz' chupam chi ja.

One house of death bats,                            Jun ja chi kama sotz',
Great animals.                                      Nima'q chikop.

Like the blades their snouts,                       Keje' ri cha ki tza'm,
Their means of murder.                              Ki kamisab'al.

Straightaway they were to be finished               Ju su chutzinik
They were to arrive before their faces.             Chopon chikiwach.

They were therefore there inside                    Xek'oje' k'u chiri' chupan               4060
Merely in blowguns they slept.                      Xa pa wub' xewar wi.

Not were they eaten                                 Mawi xeti'ik
By these that are in house.                         Rumal ri' e k'o pa ja.

There therefore they gave themselves one            Chiri' k'ut xkiya' wi kib' jun wi
Because of one death bat.                           Rumal jun chi kama sotz'.

It would descend,                                   Chiqaj,
It came.                                            Xpe wi.

Merely their self-manifestation                     Xa wi u k'utb'al rib'
When they did it.                                   Ta xkib'ano.

Because hard they asked for                         Rumal ko kakitz'onoj wi                  4070
Their wisdom.                                       Ki na'oj.

                                                                                                    141
One night therefore                                         Jun aq'ab' k'u
The bats make flapping sounds with their wings:             Ri sotz' keb'ujujik:

"Keeleetz!                                                  "Kilitz!
Keeleetz!"                                                  Kilitz !"

They say,                                                   Kecha',
They say all night.                                         Kecha' jun aq'ab'.

Ceased therefore these a little.                            Xtane' k'u ri' sqaqi'n.
There is not now they move the bats.                        Maja b'i chik kesilob'ik ri sotz'.

There therefore crawling the one                            Chiri' k'u chakal wi ri jun                       4080
End blowgun.                                                Tza'm wub'.

Said therefore the Xbalanque:                               Xcha' k'u ri Xb'alanke:
"Hunahpu,                                                   "Junajpu,

Yet when its dawn you see?"                                 K'a janik' pa u saqirik kawilo?"
"Yet when it then perhaps I shall see it surely," he said   "K'a janik'an la' b'a lo wila' na," xcha' k'ut.
      therefore.

Truly therefore he wanted to look hither from its mouth     Qi k'u are' karaj muqum uloq chuchi' wub',
        blowgun,
He wanted to see sees hither its dawn.                      Karaj ril uloq u saqirik.

Then also was cut off his head by death bat,                K'ate puch ta xqupix u jolom rumal kama sotz',
Cut off now behind the greater part the Hunahpu.            Qupul chi kanoq u nimal ri Junajpu.

"How is it, not it dawned?" said the Xbalanque.             "Jucha'lik, ma mi xsaqirik?" xcha' ri
                                                                   Xb'alanke.                                 4090
There is not now he would move the Hunahpu.                 Maja b'i chik chisilob'ik ri Junajpu.

"What then, not perhaps went Hunahpu?                       "Jupacha', ma xa on mi xb'ek Junajpu?
What then you did?"                                         Jupacha' mi xab'ano?"

There was not he would move,                                Maja b'i chisilab'ik,
Merely would rustle wings now.                              Xaqi chiqosos chik.

Then therefore was ashamed Xbalanque.                       K'ate k'ut xuk'ixb'ij Xb'alanke.
"Alas, we gave in already," he said therefore.              "Akarok, mi xqaya' yan," xcha' k'ut.


142
There therefore went to place first his head,                                  Chila' k'ut xb'e k'ola na wi u jolom,
On its top ballcourt.                                                          Chuwi' jom.

Merely their word One Death,                                                   Xa wi u tzij Jun Kame,                                   4100
Seven Death.                                                                   Wuqub' Kame.

They rejoice therefore the Xibalbans all of them                               Keki'kot k'u ri Xib'alb'a konojel
Because of his head Hunahpu.                                                   Rumal u jolom Junajpu.

Then therefore he summoned animals,                                            K'ate k'ut ta xutaq chikop,
All of them:                                                                   Ronojel:

Peccary,                                                                       Aq,

All small animals,                                                             Ronojel ch'uti chikop,
Great animals,                                                                 Nima chikop,

At night,                                                                      Chaq'ab',                                                4110
Merely instead its early morning.                                              Xa wi xare raq'ab'al.

Then he asked for therefore                                                    Ta xutz'onoj k'ut
Their food.                                                                    Kecha'.

"Whatsoever your food each of you                                              "Naqi taq pa iwecha' chi jujunal
This I summon you to bring hither the your food,"                              Are' kixnutaq wi chik'am uloq ri iwecha',"

He said therefore Xbalanque to them.                                           Xcha' k'ut Xb'alanke chike.
"Good then that," they said therefore.                                         "Utz b'a la'," xecha' k'ut.

Then they went obtainers theirs,                                               Ta xeb'ek e k'amol rech,
Then they arrived many therefore all of them.                                  Ta xe'ul je k'ut konojel.

There were mere rotten things they went to get,                                K'o xa q'umar rech xb'e u k'ama',                        4120
There were mere leaves they went to get,                                       K'o xa tz'alik xb'e u k'ama',
There were mere stones they went to get,                                       K'o xa ab'aj xb'e u k'ama',
There was mere dirt they went to get.                                          K'o xa ulew xb'e u k'ama'.

Various their foods the [small] animals,                                       Jalajoj kecha' ri [ch'uti]80 chikop,

  80
       It is likely that ch'uti (small) should have been part of this couplet, paired with nima (great) as it is throughout the text.

                                                                                                                                               143
Many as well until last remaining the coati,               K'i pu k'a u xamb'e kanajoq ri sis,
Chilacayote squash she went to get.                        Q'oq' xb'e u k'ama'.

She rolls it with her nose as she comes.                   Kub'alka'tij chutza'm kapetik.
This therefore entered transformation his head Hunahpu.    Are' k'ut xok jalwachib'al u jolom Junajpu.

Immediately now were carved its seeds its face.            Lib'aj chi xk'otox u b'aq' u wach.            4130
Crowded with sages from sky came.                          Tzatz chi aj na'oj chi kaj xpe wi.

This its Heart Sky,                                        Are' u K'u'x Kaj,
Huracan.                                                   Juraqan.

He appeared hither,                                        Xulk'o loq,
He arrived therefore hither                                Xulu k'u loq

In Bat House.                                              Pa Sotz'i Ja.

Not therefore soon it was successfully completed his face, Ma k'u ata'n xutzinik u wach,
Good now it became.                                        Utz chik xuxik.

Merely only its covering beautiful it appeared,            Xa wi xare u ch'uq jeb'el xwachinik,          4140
Merely only it spoke.                                      Xa wi xare xch'awik.

While therefore then it would want to dawn,                Are k'ut ta chiraj saqirik,
It would redden its root sky.                              Chikaqtarin u xe' kaj.

"Blacken it with soot surely again,                        "Kaxaqi' na chik,

 "Fine," said the grandfather.                              "We'," xcha' ri mama'.
Then again he blackened it with soot.                      Ta chi xaqinik.

Then it was darkened again.                                K'ate ta chiq'equ'mar chik.
Four times he blackened it with soot the grandfather.      Kaj mul xaqin ri mama'.

"He blackens it with soot possum,"                         "Kaxaqin wuch',"                              4150
Say people today.                                          Kacha' winaq wakamik.

Merely therefore red blue it succeeded                     Xa k'u kaq rax utzinik
When it began its existence.                               Ta xutikib'a' u k'ojik.

"Not good?" he was told therefore Hunahpu.                 "Ma utz?" chuchax k'ut Junajpu.
"Yes good," he said therefore.                             "Je' utz," xcha' k'ut.

Merely only would be supported his head,               Xa wi xare chub'aqitila' u jolom,
Like truly his head it came to be.                     Keje' ri' qitzij u jolom xuxik.

Then therefore they made their words,                  K'ate k'ut ta xkib'an ki tzij,
They counseled together.                               Xepixab'an kib'.

"Not any you play ball,                                "Ma naqi katcha'jik,                         4160

Merely I one,                                          Xa in jun,
Truly I accomplish it," said Xbalanque to him.         Qi kinb'anowik," xcha' Xb'alanke chire.

Then therefore he instructed a rabbit:                 K'ate k'ut ta xupixab'aj jun umul:

  At head,                                               Chi wi',

Was told rabbit by Xbalanque.                          Xuchax umul rumal Xb'alanke.

"When it will come rubber ball with you,               "Chopon na kik' awuk',                       4170
Then you go out                                        K'ate katelik

Was told the rabbit,                                   Xuchax ri umul,

In the night.                                          Chaq'ab'.

Then therefore it dawned,                              K'ate k'ut ta xsaqirik,
Merely instead good their faces both of them.          Xa wi xare utz ki wach ki kab' ichal.


DROPPED again therefore their ball,                    XQAJ chi k'u ki cha'j,
Placed now therefore his head Hunahpu atop ballcourt   K'olan chi k'u u jolom Junajpu chuwi' jom.

"We triumphed already,                                 "Mi xqach'ako yan,                           4180

They were told.                                        Xe'uchaxik.

                                                                                                           145
 Merely therefore only he would call out Hunahpu:           Xa wi k'u xere chisik'in Junajpu:
 "Strike the head as rubber ball,"                          "Chak'aqa' ri jolom chi kik',"
They are told.                                             Ke'uchaxik.

"Not therefore they will harm us again,                    "Ma k'u chikiqaq'axow chik,

Quickly they went,                              Anim xeb'ek,
They arrived therefore at its mouth pit oven.   Xe'opon k'ut chuchi' choj.          4330

There therefore they wanted to force            Chiri' k'ut xeraj ch'ij wi

"Not this you pluck us this.                           "Mawi are' kojimich' wi ri'.
Not do we know our death,                              Ma pa qeta'm qa kamik,                    4340

You lords?                                             Ix ajawab'?
You will see it surely," they said therefore.          Chiwila' na," xecha' k'ut.

Then they faced each others face,                      Ta xkik'ulawachij ki wach,
They spread their hands both of them,                  Xkirip ki q'ab' ki kab' ichal,

They also headfirst when they went in pit oven,        E pu jupujuj ta xeb'ek pa choj,
There therefore they died both of them.                Chiri' k'ut xekam wi ki kab' ichal.

They rejoice now therefore                             Keki'kot chi k'ut
All Xibalbans.                                         Ronojel Xib'alb'a.

Contented their shouting,                              Taqal ki yuyub',
Contented their whistling.                             Taqal ki xulq'ab'.                        4350

"We defeated them!                                     "Mi xeqach'ako!
Truly not too soon they gave themselves," they said.   Qitzij mawi ata'n xkiya' kib'," xecha'.

Then therefore their summoning the Descended,          K'ate k'ut ki taqik ri Xulu,
Ascended,                                              Paqam,

They left behind their word.                           Xkanaj wi ki tzij.
Merely only were asked                                 Xa wi xare xtz'onox

These went their bones,                                Ri xb'e wi ki b'aqil,
When they divined Xibalbans.                           Ta xeq'ijin Xib'alb'a.

Were ground their bones,                               Xjok' ki b'aqil,
Were strewn along its course river,                    Xb'e tixoq chi raqan a',                  4360

Not therefore they went then far away.                 Ma k'u xeb'e ta chi naj.
Merely straightaway they sank beneath water.           Xa ju su xeqaj chuxe' a'.

Chosen boys they came to be,                                E cha'om k'ajolab' xe'uxik,
Merely only their faces came to be.                         Xa wi xere ki wach xuxik.

They appeared again therefore,                              Xek'utun chi k'ut,
ON fifth day therefore they appeared again.                 CHI ro' b'ix k'ut xek'utun chik.

They were seen in river by people,                          Xe'il chi ya' rumal winaq,
They two like the mere people fish they appeared.           E kaib' keje' ri xa winaq kar xewachinik.

When were seen their faces by Xibalbans,                    Ta xil ki wach kumal Xib'alb'a,
They were searched for therefore in rivers.                 Xetzukux k'ut chi taq ya'.                   4370

Very next day therefore they would appear,                  Xchuweqa k'ut kek'utunoq,
They two as poor orphans,                                   E kaib' chi meb'a'.

Rags their fronts,                                          Atz'iyaq ki wach,
Rags also on their backs,                                   Atz'iyaq pu kij,
Rags therefore their coverings.                             Atz'iyaq k'ut ki q'u'.

Not surely they would do henceforth then their appearance, Ma na chib'an an ta ki wach,
When truly they were seen by Xibalbans.                    Ta qi xe'ilik rumal Xib'alb'a.

They burned house like it truly would burn,                 Xkiporoj ja keje' ri' qitzij chik'atik,
Immediately now therefore they would create again.          Lib'aj chi k'ut chiwinaqir chik.

Crowded now Xibalbans to watch.                             Tzatz chi Xib'alb'a chika'yik.
Then they would sacrifice themselves.                       K'ate chikipus kib'.

He would die one of them,                                   Chikam jun chike,
He would throw himself down surely in death.                Chipune' na chi kaminaqil.                   4390

First they would kill themselves,                          Nab'e chikikamisaj kib',
Merely only immediately will be revived again their faces. Xa wi xere lib'aj chik'astaj wi chi u wach.

Merely they watch with admiration Xibalbans,      Xa kika'y Xib'alb'a,
When they would do it.                            Ta chikib'ano.

Its news their dances                             U tzijel ki xajoj                   4400

In ears lords One Death,                          Chi xikin ajawab' Jun Kame,
Seven Death.                                      Wuqub' Kame.

They said when they heard it,                     Xcha' ta xkita'o,
"Who the two poor orphans?                        "Naqi ri e kaib' meb'a'?

Is it true that delightful?                       La qitzij wi chi kus?
True also that beautiful                          Qitzij wi pu chi jeb'elik

Their account arrived with lords,                 Ki tzijoxik xoponik kuk' ajawab',

Then they entreated therefore their messengers,   Ta xb'ochi' k'ut ki samajel,
Summoners that they come:                         Taqol chi kepetoq:

"`May they arrive to do it,                       "`Chul ta ki b'ana',

Were told the messengers.                         Xuchax ri samajel.
They arrived therefore with the dancers.          Xe'opon k'ut kuk' ri xajol.         4420


                                                                                             153
Then they spoke therefore                                    Ta xch'aw k'ut
Their word lords to them.                                    Ki tzij ajawab' chike.

"Not then we would want to                                   "Ma b'a chiqaj

Because truly ugly our faces,                                Rumal qi itzel qa wach,
Not merely their largeness our eyes in poverty.              Ma xa ki nima'q u b'aq' qa wach chi meb'a'.

Not perhaps is seen to them merely we dancers?               Ma xa on ril chire xa oj xajol?
What then would we say to our fellow poor orphans?           Naqi ta chiqab'ij chike qach meb'a'?            4430

There is responsibility, they desire also the our dancing,   K'o k'am, kurayij nay pu ri qa xajoj,
They revive their faces with us.                             Kakik'astaj ki wach quk'.

Not like it therefore we shall do to them the lords,         Ma keje' la' k'u xchiqab'an chike ri ajawab',

They were pestered surely their faces upon misfortune,       Xelejeb'ex na ki wach chuwi' ra',
Upon pain.                                                   Chuwi' k'ax.                                    4440

Red misfortune they went,                                    Kaq ra'il xeb'ek,
Not too soon they wanted to have gone.                       Mawi ata'n xkaj b'enam.

Many times they were compelled,                              K'iya mul xech'ijik,

THEY arrived also with lords.                                XE'OPON puch kuk' ajawab'.

"Where do you come from?"                                            "Apa kixpe wi?"
They were asked.                                                     Xe'uchaxik.

"Not then we know you lord.                                          "Ma b'a qeta'on at ajaw.

Different their languages came to be.                     Jalajoj ki ch'ab'al xuxik.

Crowded they would walk,                             Tzatz chub'inik,
They arrived at Tulan.                               Xopon chi Tulan.

There was not therefore fire.                        Ma k'u ja b'i q'aq'.
 Only there are the Tohil.                            Xaqi e k'o ri Tojil.

First they created their fire.                       Nab'e xwinaqir u q'aq'.

Not clear its creation.                              Mawi q'alaj u winaqirik.

"Alas, there is not our fire came to be,             "Akarok, maja b'i qa q'aq' mi xuxik,

They said therefore.                                         Xecha' k'ut.
Then spoke therefore the Tohil:                              Ta xch'aw k'ut ri Tojil:

"Do not mourn.                                               "Mixb'isonik.

Should you lose the fire.                                    Chisach ri q'aq'.

"Not truly you god?                                          "Ma qitzij at k'ab'awil?

They said to him when they gave thanks for this.             Xecha' chire ta xkik'amowaj ri'.
Said Tohil:                                                  Xub'ij Tojil:

Good then that,                                              "Utz b'a la',

   Then be it so,"                                             Ta chuxoq,"

They were told the bloodletters,                             Xe'uchaxik ri aj k'ixb',
Sacrificers by Tohil.                                        Aj k'ajb' rumal Tojil.

This therefore their glory the nations.                      Are' k'ut ki q'aq'al ri amaq'.
They rejoice because of their fire.                          Keki'kotik rumal ki q'aq'.

      This is a singular instance in which Ximénez glosses the text with a brief comment in Latin, referring to the messenger from Xibalba
as a demon, or devil. That Ximénez chose to do this only once and in Latin argues for the overall accuracy of the Maya text as he
transcribed it.

This therefore his being given breast that he said Tohil.   Are' k'ut u tu'xik ri xub'ij Tojil.

Then were sacrificed all nations before him,                Ta xpus ronojel amaq' chuwach,
Then were carved out hither their hearts                    Ta xk'otix uloq u k'u'x

Never ending fast they did.                             Junelik mewajik xkib'ano.

But they fix their eyes on the its dawn,                Xere kiselawachin ri u saqirik,
They observe its coming out hither sun.                 Kilawachin relik ula q'ij.

They occupy themselves in looking for the Great Star,   Kejalow kib' chi rilik ri Nima Ch'umil,

Green Passes Before Sun.                                Raxa Ik'oq'ij.
Always therefore there it is its face                   Amaq'el k'u chila' k'o wi ki wach

Came their gods.                                        Xpe wi ki k'ab'awil.

They received their glory,                              Xkik'am wi ki q'aq'al,
Their lordship as well.                                 Kajawarem puch.

But rather there they were conquered,                   Xawi chila' xch'ataj wi,
They were humiliated,                                   Xyoq'otaj wi,

They gave their blood,                                                      Xuya'o u kik'el,

Straightaway at Tulan came their glory.                                     Ju su chi Tulan xpe wi ki q'aq'al.
Great knowledge there is with them.                                         Nima eta'mab'al k'o kuk'.

In darkness therefore,                                                      Chi q'equ'mal k'ut,                      5730
In night as well they did it.                                               Chi aq'ab'al puch xkib'ano.

They came then therefore,                                                   Xepe chi k'ut,
They were pulled up then hither there.                                      Xeb'oqotaj chi ula chila'.

They left behind then                                                       Xkikanaj chik

"Good then that," they said therefore.                                      "Utz b'a la'," xecha' k'ut.              5750

Always therefore they would look for the star,                              Amaq'el k'ut chikil ri ch'umil,

They gathered themselves.                         Xekuchu wi kib'.
There therefore they gave names to each other:    Chiri' k'ut xkikob'isaj wi kib':

Like there was not sea they passed through hither.   Keje' ri' maja b'i palo xe'ik'ow wi uloq.
Only on its top stones they passed through hither.   Xa chuwi' taq ab'aj xe'ik'ow wi uloq.

There were here the stones on sand.                  K'oleje' ula ri ab'aj pa sanayeb'.          5830
Then they named it therefore:                        Ta xkib'i'natisaj k'ut:

They made it their citadel therefore this came to be.         Xkitinamit k'u ri' xuxik.

That was hidden by them.                                      Ri xewax kumal.

Not surely in forest was Hacavitz.                            Ma na pa k'eche'laj xk'oje' wi Jaq'awitz.
Merely cleared mountain was hidden Hacavitz.                  Xa saqi juyub' xewax wi Jaq'awitz.

 Hacavitz.                                             Jaq'awitz.


THIS its beginning now their being abducted people,   WA'E u tikarik chik releq'axik winaq,
Nations,                                              Amaq',

By Balam Quitze,                                      Kumal B'alam Kitze,
Balam Acab,                                           B'alam Aq'ab',
Mahucutah,                                            Majukutaj,
Iqui Balam.                                           Ik'i B'alam.


THEN as well their being killed nations these.        K'ATE puch u kamisaxik amaq' ri'.       6510
They took them thus:                                  Are' xkik'am ri':

Only one would go walking,                            Xa jun chub'inik,
Only two would go walking.                            Xa kaib' chub'inik.


                                                                                                     225
Not clear then they would take them.                  Mawi q'alaj ta chkik'amo.
Thus then they would go to sacrifice them             K'ate k'ut ta chib'e ki pusu'

Before their faces Tohil,                             Chuwach Tojil,
Auilix.                                               Awilix.

Then therefore they would give blood on road,         K'ate k'ut ta chikiya' kik' pa b'e,
There is their skulls they would place on road.       K'olik u jolom chikik'olob'a' pa b'e.

They say therefore the nations, "Jaguar ate them,"    Kecha' k'ut ri amaq', "B'alam mi xti'owik," 6520
Only they say.                                        Xa kecha'.

Because like the paws jaguar                          Rumal keje' ri raqan b'alam
Their feet then they would make.                      Kaqan ta chikib'ano.

Not would they reveal themselves.                     Mawi chikik'ut kib'.
Crowded with nations they abducted.                   Tzatz chi amaq' xkeleq'aj.

Until its long time therefore                         K'a u najt k'ut
They felt themselves nations.                         Xuna' wi rib' amaq'.

"Perhaps these the Tohil,                             "We are' ri Tojil,
Auilix enter to us.                                   Awilix kok chiqe.

Only we seek them the bloodletters,                   Xa keqatzukuj ri aj k'ixb',                6530
Sacrificers,                                          Aj k'ajb',

When it they are at their homes.                      Ta la k'o wi kochoch.
Let us follow their feet,"                            Chiqataqej ri kaqan,"

They said therefore all nations                       Xecha' k'ut konojel amaq'
When they gathered their thoughts among themselves.   Ta xkik'am ki na'oj chi kib'il kib'.

Then therefore they began                             K'ate k'ut xkitikib'a'
Its following their feet                              U taqexik kaqan

The bloodletters,                                     Ri aj k'ixb',
Sacrificers.                                          Aj k'ajb'.

Not therefore clear, only feet deer,                  Ma k'u q'alaj, xa raqan kej,               6540
Only feet jaguars they would see.                     Xa raqan b'alam chikilo.


226
Not clear their feet.                                        Mawi q'alaj kaqan.
Nowhere there was clear                                      Xma k'o wi q'alaj wi

Where first their feet the only their paws,                  Are nab'e kaqan ri xa ki pich,
Like this their feet only confusion its                      Keje' ri' kaqan xa sachb'al re

By them.                                                     Kumal.
Not clear their path.                                        Mawi q'alaj ki b'e.

Only would be created clouds,                                Xa chiwinaqir sutz',
Only would be created dark rain,                             Xa chiwinaqir q'eqal jab',
Only as well would be created mud,                           Xa pu chiwinaqir xoq'ol,                  6550
Only would be created drizzling rain.                        Xa chiwinaqir musmul jab'.

They would see it                                            Chikilo
Before their faces nations.                                  Chikiwach amaq'.

Only therefore they would weary their hearts seeking them, Xa k'u chikos ki k'u'x chikitzukuxik,
Then they would mourn as well.                             Ta chikoq'otaj puch.

Because great their essence                                  Rumal nim u k'oje'ik
The Tohil,                                                   Ri Tojil,

Auilix,                                                      Awilix,
Hacavitz.                                                    Jaq'awitz.

Long time therefore they did it there on its top mountain,   Najt k'ut xkib'an chiri' chuwi' juyub',   6560
On its edges the nations.                                    Chuxikin ri amaq'.

They killed.                                                 Xkikamisaj.
 This then was created the abduction,                         Are' ta xwinaqir ri eleq'ik,
 Murderous assaults,                                          E ch'alami q'at,
When they would take the nations on roads.                   Ta chikik'am ri amaq' pa taq b'e.

They would sacrifice them                                    Chikipus
Before their faces                                           Chuwach

The Tohil,                                                   Ri Tojil,

Saved therefore their sons there                             Xkolo k'ut ki k'ajol chiri'

                                                                                                              227
On its top mountain.                                       Chuwi' juyub'.

Where were Tohil,                                          Are Tojil,
Auilix,                                                    Awilix,
Hacavitz.                                                  Jaq'awitz.

Three boys their appearance they would walk,               Oxib' chi k'ajolab' ki wachib'al keb'inik;
Only their spirit essence the stones.                      Xa u nawal ri ab'aj.

There was a river,                                         Xk'oje' jun ja',
Where they bathe                                           Are ke'atin wi

At its mouth river.                                        Chuchi' ja'.

Only their self manifestation.                             Xa ki k'utb'al kib'.
It gave its name therefore:                                Xub'i'naj k'ut:

At His Bath Tohil,                                         Chi Ratinib'al Tojil,
Its name river came to be.                                 U b'i' ja' xuxik.

Many times therefore they would see them nations.          K'iya mul k'ut chikilo amaq'.
Suddenly then they would be lost themselves.               Lib'aj chi chikisachix taj kib'.

When they were seen                                        Ta ke'ilik
By nations.                                                Rumal amaq'.

Then would come to be its report                           Ta xux taj u tzijel                          6590

This therefore this its gathering their thoughts nations   Are' k'u wa' u k'amik u na'oj amaq'
So that they may be killed.                                Chire u kamisaxik taj.


FIRST therefore they desired                               NAB'E k'ut xraj

They assembled themselves,                      Xkejek kib',
They summoned as well each other all of them.   Xketaq pu kib' konojel.

There was not one group,                        Maja b'i ju ch'ob',

They summoned as well each other.               Xetaqo pu kib'.                   6610

They spoke therefore,                           Xecha' k'ut,
They asked themselves:                          Ta xkitz'onob'ej kib':

If therefore then you see them the three boys,        We k'ut ta ke'iwil ri e oxib' k'ajolab',
Undress therefore yourselves before their faces.      Chisonob'a' k'u iwib' chikiwach.

If therefore will desire their hearts to you,         We k'ut chirayin ki k'u'x chiwe,
You offer yourselves.                                 Kixchoko.

`We come then after you,'                             `Kojopon ta chiwij,'
When they say to you,                                 Ta kecha' chiwech,

When you are petitioned therefore.                    Ta kixtz'onox k'ut.

`Where from you come,                                 `Apa kixpe wi,                                 6670
Where are they by whom daughters?'                    Apa aj choq' mi'al?'

Then you say, `we their daughters lords,'             Ta kecha', `Oj ki mi'al ajawab','
You say therefore to them.                            Kixcha' k'u chike.

`Come therefore their sign by you.'                   `Chipe k'u retal iwumal.'
Then something they will give to you.                 Ta naqi la' chikiya' chiwe.

If they will desire your faces,                       Taseq chikirayij i wach,

Said therefore the lords,                             Xecha' k'u ri ajawab',
When they were instructed the maidens.                Ta xepixab'ax ri q'apojib'.

They were adorned in finery.                            Xekawuxik.
Truly then beautiful they would appear                  Qitzij wi chi jeb'elik chiwachinik

They carry on their heads therefore                     Kikarilo'on k'u
The their wash when they went.                          Ri ki ch'ajo'n ta xeb'ek.

They rejoice then therefore the lords                   Keki'kot chi k'u ri ajawab'
Because of the two their daughters they sent thither.   Kumal ri e kaib' ki mi'al xkitaq ub'ik.

When they arrived therefore at river                    Ta xe'opon k'ut chi ya'

They undressed themselves each of them,                 Xkitzonob'a' kib' ki kab' ichal,
On their hands and knees before their faces stones.     E chakachaxinaq chuwach taq ab'aj.

"Where do you come from?"                                 "Apa kixpe wi?"

When they laid out straight their mission.                    Ta xkisuk'ub'a' ki taqikil.

This then therefore they desired the nations:                 Are' ta k'u xkaj ri amaq':
They were violated then the maidens                           Xejox ta ri q'apojib'

Their disturbances as well.                                   Ki yujuj puch.

Only purity,                                                  Xa saq,
Only sense of community there is in their hearts.             Xa amaq' k'o chi ki k'u'x.

There was not left facing,                                    Maja b'i moxwachinik,                     7590
There was not as well fire facing                             Ma pu ja b'i q'aq'wachinik

They did.                                                     Xkib'ano.
Still small their glory.                                      K'a ch'uti'noq ki q'aq'al.

Not yet they have pulled it together,                         Maja ki kanuk'maijoq,
Not as well they have become great.                           Maja pu kanimaroq.

Then they tried it therefore,                                 Ta xkitij k'ut,
They strengthened shield                                      Xkikowisaj pokob'

Certainly sign therefore their lordship this when they did it. Xretal k'ut kajawarem ri' ta xkib'ano.   7600
Certainly sign their glory,                                    Xretal ki q'aq'al,
Sign as well their greatness.                                  Retal nay pu ki nimal.

Then it was seen therefore by Ilocab,                         Ta xil k'ut rumal Ilokab',
Then was created war by Ilocab.                               Ta xwinaqir lab'al rumal Ilokab'.

They desired he be murdered the lord Co Tuja.              Xraj ul kamisaxoq ri ajaw K'o Tuja.
Only therefore one lord they desired therefore themselves. Xa k'u jun ajaw xraj k'u kib'.

This the lord Iztayul they desired to convince,               Are' ri ajaw Istayul xraj ki tijoj,

                                                                                                               263
They wanted that he be convinced by Ilocab to kill.        Xraj tijox kumal Ilokab' chi kamisanik.

Not therefore went out                                     Ma k'u xel aponoq
Their left facedness behind his back lord Co Tuja.         Ki moxwachib'al chirij ajaw K'o Tuja.     7610

Only behind their backs it fell.                           Xa chikij xqaj wi.
Not first died then the lord by Ilocab.                    Ma nab'e xkam ta ri ajaw rumal Ilokab'.

Thus its foundation disturbance,                           Keje' k'ut u xe'najik yujuj
Clamor war as well.                                        Ch'akimal lab'al puch.

They invade first citadel,                                 Xkokib'ej nab'e tinamit,
They went as killers.                                      Xeb'ek e kamisanel.

This then therefore they desired,                          Are' ta k'u xkaj,
The loss then their faces Quichés.                         Ri sach ta u wach K'iche'.

Only then by themselves they exercised lordship in their   Xa ta ki tukel xajawarik chi ki k'u'x,
       hearts,
Only therefore they arrived to receive.                    Xa k'u are' xe'ul k'amoq.                 7620

They were captured,                                        Xeteleche'xik,
They were despoiled therefore.                             Xekanab'ix puch.

Not many again                                             Mawi jarub' chik
Were liberated of them.                                    Xkolotaj chike.

Then began therefore sacrificing,                          Ta xtiker k'ut pusunik,
They sacrificed the Ilocab before his face god.            Xepus ri Ilokab' chuwach k'ab'awil.

This now payment their offense came to be                  Are' chik tojb'al ki mak xuxik
By lord Co Tuja.                                           Rumal ajaw K'o Tuja.

Many therefore entered into captivity,                     K'i chi k'ut xok chi munil,
They were enslaved,                                        Xe'alab'ilaxik,                           7630
They were made to be servants as well.                     Xewinaqix puch.

Only they went to give themselves                          Xa xb'e kiya' kib'
To being defeated                                          Chi ch'akix
Because of their clamor war                                Rumal ki nuk'b'al lab'al

Mocked then its face their lordship Quichés,                Xk'utux ta u wach rajawal K'iche'

Desired their hearts.                                       Xraj ki k'u'x.
Not therefore it was done.                                  Ma k'u xb'anatajik.                         7640

Their sacrifice people before his face god.                 U pusik winaq chuwa k'ab'awil.

Then they made the shield                                   Ta xb'an ri pokob'

Then they began its shielding citadel Chi Izmachi,          Ta xtikarik u pokob'axik tinamit Chi Ismachi',
There began its foundation glory.                           Chila' xtikar wi u xe'najik q'aq'al.

Because of this certainly great his lordship Quiché lord,   Rumal ri' xa xnim wi rajawarem K'iche' ajaw,
Everywhere enchanted lords.                                 Jumaj e nawal ajawab'.
